Well clouds and I see a shape
Pretty girl through the night and day
Run around fast away
I pass the shadows where I stay
Long, long hair and I'm not there
And when the wind dissolves the clouds
The street light girl is the only witness

The girl behind the mask
She's the one who never has to ask, yeah

With magic pouring from her eyes
There's nothing she can't recognise
Makes me want to understand
Makes me feel like melting black
When your the last flash and time stands still
I ask what if all I could recall
Had never been in the dream that she could see

Girl behind the mask
She's the one who never has to ask
She reaches through your disguise
It's too late - you never realised
And I never realised

Up the stairs a picture's waiting
In my room she might be waiting
We're baptised still getting blind in the darkness
If I get back to her I'd walk away into the forest
And then I'm thinking 'where can I go Lord?'

Girl behind the mask is the one
Who never has to ask
She's reaching through your disguise
It's too late
You never realised, you never realised

[Please don't, please don't, please don't]
