[00:30.84] Don't you come too close to me
[00:36.12] You're dangerous, can't you see
[00:42.47] You can make the darkness mean more
[00:48.41] Then it ever did
[00:50.72] Ever did before
[00:58.22] 
[00:53.74] It's a devil's disguise
[00:57.04] Angel in black
[01:00.01] And I recognize the face behind the mask
[01:05.85] It's a devil's disguise
[01:09.18] Angel in black
[01:12.13] I don't know if I want you back
[01:27.63] 
[01:18.66] You're the cool nights of the desert
[01:24.15] And the hot kisses of the sun
[01:30.29] Why is it that I don't belive you
[01:36.12] When you say I'm the only one
[01:38.76] I know I'm the lonely one
[01:51.26] 
[01:42.27] It's a devil's disguise
[01:45.15] Angel in black
[01:48.66] And I recognize the shadows from your past
[01:54.20] It's a devil's disguise
[01:57.37] Angel in black
[02:00.73] Don't you know it'll never last
[02:04.60] The face behind the mask
[02:16.60] 
[02:50.37] There will never be a second chance for you
[02:55.05] Oh No
[02:56.82] Not for you
[03:02.32] 
[03:01.80] It's a devil's disguise
[03:03.85] Angel in black
[03:07.31] And I recognize the face behind the mask
[03:12.87] It's a devil's disguise
[03:15.81] Angel in black
[03:19.06] Don't you know it'll never last
[03:23.38] The face behind the mask
[03:25.59] It's a devil's disguise
[03:27.87] Angel in black
[03:31.50] And I recognize the shadows from your past
[03:37.53] It's a devil's disguise
[03:40.01] Angel in black
[03:43.81] I don't know if I want you back
[03:47.38] I don't know if I want you back
[04:09.50] Don't you know it'll never last
[04:11.65] The face behind the mask
